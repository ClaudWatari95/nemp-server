# The New E-Mail Protocol (NEMP) - server software

The classic e-mail protocol is more than 40 years old and has been very little modified since the mid-1990s. It lacks modern features.

This project aims to replace the existing e-mail protocols (SMTP, IMAP, POP3 etc.) using modern technologies. It is very easy to install and it is all-in-one (server, web admin, web mail client, developer console etc.). It takes all advantages from classic e-mail protocol and combines it with modern features.
